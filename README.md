# Sorry-NovelAI
It is sorry to offend NovelAI developers.

Because of DMCA the colab repo has been taken down. More detailed : https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/10/2022-10-31-novelai.md

I will not write anythin about novelai. But I will write something about "ImageAI".

# I don't do any tutorial for NovelAI now
## I done some new repo and tutorial called "ImageAI" Please take a look
* [ImageAI colab ver](https://github.com/JingShing/ImageAI-colab-ver)
* [ImageAI low vram ver](https://github.com/JingShing/ImageAI-4chan-lowvram-ver)
* [ImageAI installation tutorial](https://github.com/JingShing/ImgaeAI-installation-tutorial)

# I am so sad about what I had done
## I made [this vid for apologize to NovelAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyIL7XjMUaw)

</a>

# BTW
## I made a tool for [encrypt and decrypt](https://github.com/JingShing/Encryptor-Decryptor)
You can get it [here](https://github.com/JingShing/Encryptor-Decryptor).

That tool has no matter with [a encrypted script not for ai](a_script_not_for_ai).

decrypt key definitely has no matter with [this vid for apologize to NovelAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyIL7XjMUaw) of this repo.
